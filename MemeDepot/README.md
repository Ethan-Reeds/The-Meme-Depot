Welcome to Meme Depot

Before getting started please follow these guidelines:

1. When starting a new feature, create your own branch. This branch should be created from the development branch,
2. Work on your changes on your branch, and commit as you see necessary. This branch you made is local until you push it upstream.
3. Once you are ready to commit, or beforehand if you want to share progress, open a pull request from your branch to development on Github.
4. If your feature is ready, and there are no merge issues, go ahead and finish up the pull request and merge. If there are merge errors, fix them how you like and proceed. One easy way is to merge the development branch into your branch, fix merge errors, test your branch, and then you can merge that into development free of merge errors.
(If you don't know how to fix your merge error or just are unsure what to keep, tag someone who does in your pull request. If you are unsure who to tag just @Spookyturbo
5. Go ahead and make sure development works, run all its tests, as long as everything is working, merge into master.
